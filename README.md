# Hack the North - Orion Data

Orion Data is a video consumption platform with a twist, users have the option to turn on their webcam allowing our AI to differentiate their emotions and provide accurate video recommendations based on if the video was enjoyed.

This platform also allows content creators to better understand the people who viewed their video and gives them hard data on which parts of their videos they need to improve to become better at their craft. 

This is a short video demo of the capabilities of the Orion Data platform created by Alex Gordienko and Sid Gupta.
